Hello,

My name is Vlad Yakovenko, and I’m writing to express my interest in a
backend/Python developer position at your company.
With over 8 years of professional experience,
I have built scalable backend systems, RESTful APIs, data pipelines, and
cloud-native services especially using Python, Django / FastAPI, AWS, Docker,
and CI/CD practices.

During my career I have:  
- Designed and implemented ETL pipelines and data processing workflows;  
- Developed web applications with real-time updates (Dash / Flask);  
- Managed deployments on cloud infrastructure (AWS ECS)
- Worked remotely in asynchronous teams, using tools such as Slack, GitHub, Jira,
  and more to maintain productivity and clear communication.  

I currently live in Thailand (UTC+7), and have been working remotely for many
years — I’m comfortable collaborating across time zones and using asynchronous
workflows effectively. I’m actively looking for a role where I can contribute my
backend, data, and cloud experience to build robust and maintainable systems.

I believe my skills and background make me a strong match for a backend
engineering role in a remote-first or distributed team. I would welcome the
opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards, 
Vlad.
